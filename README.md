### Project Details:
Pick any programming language of your choice and test-drive creating a list of the top 100 most frequently occurring words (excluding stop words) paired with the count of occurrences of the word, found in the attached text for Herman Melville's book Moby Dick.  
### I made two versions one in Python and one in JavaScript:
##### Python:
First I made a python version only focusing on solving the problem and simply displaying the results as plain text output.
##### JavaScript
Then I made a web version to allow the user to select the text files and added options to include or exclude hypenated compound words, abreviations, and strings with numbers such as "1st" or numbers and dates. And also to display everything in a neat looking web format.
